Asset tracking is a task over the years. Asset Tracking using Beacons is the main idea . 
Beacons can be a game changer in this. 
Beacons are some small Bluetooth radio transmitters.
Standard Beacons range for 70 meters.
Asset Tracking can be done for 35-400 meters using Beacons.
Beacons are a small devices , based on BLE technology i.e., Bluetooth Low Energy .
Using BLE , beacons transmits a unique Id for every 1/10th of a second.
Any Smart phone with Bluetooth can detect the UUID and it gets to know which beacon is next to it.
All the data required for action is taken from the cloud, as the device connects to that specific beacon.
In a warehouse rather than finding out a product manually by filtering. Beacons can bring a great change in spotting any product in a single tap.
